This is a simple Python program that asks for your name, age, and favorite song, and responds with personalized messages. It uses string concatenation, input handling, and type conversion.

## What I Learned
- Variables and strings
- Getting user input with `input()`
- Type conversion using `int()`
- String formatting and concatenation

## Sample Run

Hey I am Penuel Stanley-Zebulon!  
You're now in the system! You can't go back now MWAHAHAHA!!!

You will be 24 in five years!

What is your favorite song?: Mr Telephone Man
