# Intro Bot: The Genesis Project

This is a simple Python program that asks for your name, age, and favorite song, and responds with personalized messages. It uses string concatenation, input handling, and type conversion.

## What I Learned
- Variables and strings
- Getting user input with `input()`
- Type conversion using `int()`
- String formatting and concatenation

## Sample Run
